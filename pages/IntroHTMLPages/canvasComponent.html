		<h1>The Canvas Component</h1>

		<p>
			The Canvas component is a two-dimensional, touch-sensitive
			rectangular grid. It's like a piece of
			paper in the app that can be drawn on. You can also place images on it and
			animate those images.
		</p>

		<p>
			You draw and place objects in a Canvas using an X-Y grid that is similar
			to the one used in Math. The Canvas is made up of pixels--the tiniest dots of color that can 
			appear on a screen. Each pixel’s location is defined by an X-Y coordinate. X defines a location 
			on the horizontal plane (starting at 0 on the far left and increasing as you move to the 
			right across the screen), and Y defines a location on the vertical plane (starting at 0 at the top and 
			increasing as you move down the screen).
		</p>
		<p>
The top-left cell in a Canvas starts with 0 for both coordinates(X=0,Y=0). As you move right, 
the X coordinate increases; as you move down, the Y coordinate increases. The upper-right corner has an X coordinate 
equal to the width of the Canvas minus 1. The App Inventor canvas coordinate system is different than the traditional 
cooridinate system, as you can see
the figure below. </p>

			<p>
			You'll find the Canvas component in the "Drawing and Animation" drawer
			of the designer. When you drag a Canvas component onto the screen, it starts
			out really small because its current Width and Height properties are set
			to automatic.</p>	
			<p>
			Automatic means that the size of the Canvas will change in regards to
			what is inside the canvas component. Since nothing is in it to start, it appears small.
			Typically you'll change the width of the Canvas to "Fill parent", which will make it span
			the entire width of the screen.) You'll change its
			Height to around 300 or another static value that determines how much of
			the screen real estate will be allocated to the Canvas.
