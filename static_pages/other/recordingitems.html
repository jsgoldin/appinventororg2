<h2>How do you record information in a list?</h2>

		<h3>Example 1. How do you record notes input by the user?</h3>
 			<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/recordingitems/notesToList.png" border="0"/>
          <p>
			This behavior illustrates the basics of a note taking or twitter-like app. 
			You first define a variable <span class="empfont">noteList</span> and initialize it to the create empty 
			list block. This marks the variable <span class="empfont">noteList</span> as a list so you can put items 
			into it.
		  </p> 
		<p>When the user enters a note in the <span class="empfont">NoteTextBox</span> and clicks 
		“Submit”, add items to list is called to append the user’s entry to the end of 
		the list. noteList is then set into <span class="empfont">ListLabel.Text</span> to display it to the user, and 
		the user’s entry in <span class="empfont">NoteTextBox</span> is blanked out to ready it for the next entry.</p>
	<p>Note: this data in this sample is not persistent, meaning the notes entered by the 
	user will only be recorded for the current run of the app. If you stopped the app and 
	re-opened it, the notes list would be empty. To learn how to record data persistently, 
	see <a href="/Persistence">these notes</a></p>

		  <h3>Example 2. How do you record the phone numbers of incoming SMS texts and then call 
		  one randomly to tell them they've won a prize?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/recordingitems/pickWinner.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
			This app is great for contests. You ask your audience to text you, then you 
			click a button to pick a winner and the winner’s phone rings! 
			</p>

		<p>You first define a variable <span class="empfont">incomingTexts</span> and initialize it to the create 
		empty list block. This marks the variable as a list so you can put items into it.</p>

		<p>When a text comes in, <span class="empfont">Texting.MessageReceived</span> is triggered. The app first 
		checks to make sure the number isn’t already in the list. If it is not, the number
		 is added to the list.</p>

		<p>When ready, the user can click the <span class="empfont">PickWinnerButton.Click</span> button. In that
		 event-handler, pick a random item is called to to grab a lucky winner and a 
		 <span class="empfont">PhoneCall</span> component is used to call the number.</p>
