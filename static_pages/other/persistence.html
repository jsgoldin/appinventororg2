<h2>How do you record data persistently?</h2>
          <p>
			When you enter information into your Facebook page or another app, and that
			 information is saved so it is there next time you visit, it is persistent 
			 data. The opposite--data that “dies” when you close the app-- is called 
			 transient data. Persistent data is stored in a database or file system, 
			 and not just in the application’s short-term memory. App Inventor provides
			  the <span class="empfont">TinyDB</span> component for storing data in the phone or tablet’s persistent 
			  storage. Check out these examples of using <span class="empfont">TinyDB</span> to store data persistently:

		  <h3>Example 1. How do you persistently record an out-going message for an SMS text auto-responder?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/persistence/persistentMessage.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
			This sample is from a “text answering machine” app that lets you record a 
			message to be sent in auto-reply to texts sent to your phone. When the user 
			enters a message, it should be remembered persistently so the user doesn't 
			have to type it in again when the app is closed and re-launched (unless the
			 user wants to change the outgoing message).
			 </p>
			 <p>

			When the user enters a new message and clicks “Submit”, the entered message
			 is copied from <span class="empfont">OutgoingMessageTextBox</span> into the <span class="empfont">OutgoingMessageLabel</span>, 
			 which displays the current message. Then TinyDB.StoreValue is called to
			  remember the entry persistently-- to record the newly entered message in 
			  the database. The tag “message” names the entry in the database, and the 
			  value stored is what the user entered. The final row of blocks within 
			  <span class="empfont">SubmitButton.Click</span> just blank out the OutgoingMessageTextBox so it is 
			  ready for a new entry.
			</p>
			 <p>

			Storing the data is just part of the equation-- you also need to retrieve 
			the data, to bring it from the database into the app. In this app, the data 
			is retrieved in the <span class="empfont">Screen.Initialize</span> event, which is triggered when the app 
			is opened. The <span class="empfont">TinyDB.GetValue</span> call asks the database to return the data 
			tagged “message”. If the user has submitted something previously, the entry 
			will be returned. If there is nothing yet in the database, <span class="empfont">TinyDB.GetValue</span>
			 returns the text in <span class="empfont">valueIfNotThere</span> (a default message).

			<h3>Example 2. How do you persistently record notes entered by the user?</h3>
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/persistence/recordInListDB.png" border="0"/>
			<p>
			The user enters a note and clicks "Submit". In <span class="empfont">SubmitButton.Click</span>, the item is added
			 to the variable noteList, and then the list, as a whole, is stored to the 
			 database with the tag “notes”. The new list is displayed in <span class="empfont">ListLabel</span> and 
			 the textbox is blanked out.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 When the app is closed and re-opened, <span class="empfont">Screen.Initialize</span> is triggered. 
			 <span class="empfont">TinyDB.GetValue</span> is called to retrieve the list previously stored in the 
			 database. The result is placed it in the <span class="empfont">noteList</span> variable. If there are 
			 no notes in the database, e.g., the first time the app is used, then 
			 <span class="empfont">TinyDB.GetValue</span> returns the <span class="empfont">valueIfTagNotThere</span> value, which is specified
			  as an empty list.

		<h3>Related Information</h3>
			<p>For these samples, the data is stored right on the device so it is 
			“local” to the device and really for a single user (e.g., the note taking 
			app is for private notes). When data is meant to be shared amongst multiple
			 devices and users, a web database is required.
			</p><p>
			The samples provide only rudimentary list display-- the lists are dumped 
			into a label and by default listed in the form: (item1 item2).
