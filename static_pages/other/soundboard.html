	<h4>Working in teams of two, build a "mediaboard" app of your
		choosing. A mediaboard app displays some image buttons. When each
		button is clicked, some media is played. The app can be about almost
		anything, but it must have:</h4>



	<ul>
		<li>A complex user interface arrangement, using a
			TableArrangement and/or Vertical and HorizontalArrangement
			components.</li>
		<li>At least four different media played in response to different
			events (e.g., button clicks).</li>
		<li>Some decision-making (an if-block).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Ideas</h3>
	<p>Here are some ideas to get you thinking?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A soundboard playing notes from your favorite songs or
			favorite people and speeches.</li>
		<li>Educational software for kids, e.g., farm animal app</li>
		<li>A <i>name that tune</i> game that plays song notes and
			displays the song name (answer) after the user clicks a button.
		</li>

		<li>An app that does different things when it receives a text
			from another phone.</li>
		<li>An app about your school/organization providing info about
			different places on campus.</li>
		<li>An app that lets you click on pics of your classmates to see
			their name and hear their voice.<br>
		</li>
		<li>Anything you can think of-- just run it by your instructor</li>

	<p>
		Create a single app page on one of the team member's portfolios. The
