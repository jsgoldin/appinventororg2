<h2>How do you increment a variable or component property?</h2>
          <p>
			Component properties and variables are <em>named memory cells</em>, something like the cells in a spreadsheet. 
			You’ll use such memory cells to do things like keep the score of a game or record the location of an ImageSprite.
		  </p> 

		   
		   <p>
			Often, you need to change the value stored in a memory cell. Its simple to think of setting the score of a game to 
			5, or some other <em>fixed number</em>, but how do you set the score relative to its current value, e.g., <em>how do you program it so that the 
			score becomes one more?</em>The following examples will demonstrate this fundamental activity of <em>incrementing</em> a variable.

		<h3>Example 1. How do you count the number of times a button has been clicked?</h3>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/incrementingvariables/clickAddOneUI.png" border="0"/>
		<p>
			In this really silly game, the user scores a point by clicking a button. When the button labeled “Score a Point” 
			is clicked, the ScoreLabel (showing 0 above) changes to 1. If it is clicked again, it changes to 2, and so on. 
			Here are the blocks for this behavior:
		</p>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/incrementingvariables/incrementScore.png" border="0"/>
		<p>The blocks can be confusing, at first, but understanding them is a key to understanding how computing works.  Simply put, the blocks 
		can be read as, “when the button is clicked, </p>
		<p><b>change <span class="empfront">ScoreLabel.Text</span> to its previous value + 1 </b></p>
		<p>But let’s examine the blocks more closely so that you really understand what is happening. “set” means “change”, so the 
		left, dark green block means, “change the ScoreLabel’s text”. </p>
		<p>The lighter green block labeled “ScoreLabel.Text” is a “get” block. “get” means to go look in a memory cell and see what
		 is there. The first time the button is clicked, the “get” returns the inital value of 0, so 0+1=1 is set into ScoreLabel.Text
		  (and 1 appears in the user interface). The second time the button is clicked, the current value of ScoreLabel.Text is 1, so 1+1=2
		   is placed into <span class="empfront">ScoreLabel.Text</span>.</p>
		<p>It can help to realize that <em>the blocks are really executed right-to-left</em>. The app first evaluates the right-side “+” 
		by “getting” the current value in the label and adding 1 to it. The left-side is then performed and the result of the “+” is “set” into the label.

		<h3>Example 2. How do you count-down from 10 and play a sound at 0.</h3>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/incrementingvariables/countDown.png" border="0"/>
		<p>
			With the Countdown app, a label shows a 10 to start and then begins counting down, 9,8,7...down to 0. When 0 is reached, a sound is played. Here are the blocks:
		</p>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/incrementingvariables/countDownBlocks.png" border="0"/>
		<p>The “when Clock.Timer” is triggered periodically. The top row of blocks <em>decrements</em> <span class="empfront">CountLabel.Text</span>-- the text is set to itself minus 1. So the first time the timer triggers, the text is set to 10-1=9, the second time to 9-1=8, and so on.On each iteration, the app uses an if block to check if the count has reached 0. If it has, the sound is played and the clock timer is disabled to stop the activity.
