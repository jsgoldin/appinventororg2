<h2>How and why should I define a procedure?</h2>

			A procedure is a named sequence of instructions (blocks). In real life, when 
			I tell my son to  “brush your teeth”, I really mean for him to perform a bunch 
			of detailed steps like grabbing his toothbrush, opening the toothpaste, putting 
			it on the toothbrush, etc. “brush your teeth” is a procedure, a name for a sequence 
			of instructions. In App Inventor, you can define a procedure, place blocks into it, 
			and then can call it from anywhere in the app. 
			</p><p>
			Consider the code to the right.
			Both event handlers have code to display a list. When a user submits a new entry (
			<span class="empfont">when SubmitButton.Click</span>), 
			the item is added to the list and the list is displayed. When the app is launched (
			<span class="empfont">when Screen.Initialize</span>), 
			the data is retrieved from the database into the list, and the list is displayed. 
			The blocks to display a list are the same in the two event handlers.

		This code is ripe for refactoring. Refactoring means to modify the code so that it is 
		more readable and maintainable from a programmer’s perspective-- refactoring doesn’t change 
		the behavior of the app at all. 
		</p> 
		   <p>
		Removing duplicate code is a common way to refactor. The basic idea is that software changes 
		a lot: bugs are found that need to be fixed, specifications for how the software should behave 
		change, and code, especially good code, is often repurposed. When you make changes to software, 
		you don’t want to have to find and also change a bunch of “dependencies”, e.g., other code that 
		does the same thing. It is better to have code that does a particular thing in one place, a procedure, 
		and call that procedure from all the places that need it. Then if the procedure needs to be changed, 
		it is changed in only one place.
		</p> 
		   <p>

		In the blocks to the right, the code to display a list appears in two event handlers. We can refactor 
		by defining a procedure displayList, moving the common blocks into it, then calling it from the two event handlers:

		<h3>Example 1. How do I define a procedure that displays the items of a list?</h3>

		
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/procedures/displayListProc.png" border="0"/>
		<p>
		The code to display the list is now in the procedure displayList, and both 
		<span class="empfont">SubmitButton.Click</span>
		 and <span class="empfont">Screen1.Initialize</span> call the procedure. The call block represents all the blocks within the
		  procedure definition. Calling a procedure means to jump into the blocks within the procedure 
		  and execute them. Once all the blocks are executed, program control jumps back to the block 
		  below the call. When the SubmitButton is clicked, add items to list is called and then the call 
		  to <span class="empfont">displayList</span> is made. Program control jumps down to the procedure where 
		  <span class="empfont">ListLabel.Text</span> is set 
		  to the empty string and the for each block is executed. When the for each completes, program control 
		  jumps back up to below the <span class="empfont">displayList</span> call within the when 
		  <span class="empfont">SubmitButton.Click</span> event handler-- <span class="empfont">TextBox1.Text </span>
		  is set to the empty string and <span class="empfont">TinyDB.StoreValue</span> is called.
		</p><p>
		The behavior, from a user’s perspective is the same, but the code is better from a programmer’s 
		perspective in terms of maintenance.  With this refactored code, if a bug is found in the list 
		display code, or if it is decided the list should be displayed in a different way (e.g., commas 
		in between items instead of new lines), the code would only have to be changed in one place.

		<em>Designing your App with Procedures</em>
		The example above refactors existing code. As you become familiar with procedures, you’ll 
		begin to include them from the beginning of your design process.You’ll begin to think in 
		terms of a larger software architecture consisting of event handlers, procedures, and the 
		calls between them. As you’re designing an app, before you drag in a single block, you’ll think 
		of the building blocks-- the procedures-- you need.

		<h3>Example 2. How do I define a procedure that can display any list?</h3>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/procedures/displayListparam.png" border="0"/>
          
		<p>
			A parameter is information a procedure needs to do its job. You define parameters 
			for a procedure so that it can be reused more generally. This version of <span class="empfont">displayList </span>
			has been given a parameter list so that it can be used to display any list sent to it. 
			In this case, the variable <span class="empfont">noteList</span> is sent as the parameter, but you could call it from 
			somewhere else in your app with a different list. Note that the original <span class="empfont">displayList</span> procedure
			 was specific to the variable <span class="empfont">noteList</span>-- you couldn’t use it to display other lists.
		</p>
		<p>
		There is one more issue with this procedure which makes it less than optimal for reuse. 
		This procedure displays the list you sent it in a specific label, <span class="empfont">ListLabel</span>. If your app 
		had multiple lists and labels, you’d want your <span class="empfont">displayList</span> procedure to work more generally. 
		The blocks below show how to do this:

		<h3>Example 3. How do I define a procedure that helps to display any list in any label?</h3>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/procedures/listToText.png" border="0"/>
		<p>
		Instead of actually displaying a list, the procedure does the work of converting a 
		list variable into text which can be put into any label. The procedure is generic-- 
		it takes any list and returns text, and it doesn’t refer to any specific components. 
		Any code that calls this procedure, e.g., <span class="empfont">Screen1.Initialize</span>, will provide the specific 
		list as a parameter to <span class="empfont">listToText</span>, and will place the resulting text in a specific label.
