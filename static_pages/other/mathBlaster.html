		<h2>Define and Display a List of Numbers</h2>
		<p>An important strategy in programming is to break down a problem
			into small parts, then tackle each part separately by building and
			testing blocks of code. Though the ultimate goal of this tutorial is
			to build an complete math blaster that generates random problems and
			checks them, you'll start with a more focused problem: defining a
			list and displaying that list in the user interface.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<h3>Set-up a Test User Interface</h3>





		<p>To begin, create a test user interface in the Designer. The
			final user interface will be different, but don't worry about that
			for now. Create a new project named "MathBlaster" and drag out the
			following components:
		<ol>
			<li>A label for displaying the list. Name it "NumbersLabel".</li>
			<li>A label for displaying the sum. Name it "SumLabel".</li>
			<li>A button named "ComputeButton" with the text "Compute Sum".
			</li>
		</ol>

		
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/mathBlasterTestUI.png" alt="">

		
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h3>Define the List Variable</h3>
		<p>
			Now that you've set up the user interface for this initial sub-goal,
			open the Blocks Editor. For this app, you need a variable to hold the
			list of numbers to be added up. For now, define the list with the
			numbers 5, 11, and 7, and later on we'll make it so the numbers are
			randomly generated. In the Blocks Editor, drag out an <strong>initialize
				global</strong> block from the <strong>Variables</strong> folder, a <strong>make
				a list</strong> block from the List folder, and three number blocks from the
			Math folder. Name and connect the blocks in the following manner: <br />
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/numbersList.png" /><br />
	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<h3>Display the List</h3>
		<p>
			The <strong>numbers</strong> list variable, like all variables, is
			part of the app's hidden memory. If you want such data to appear in
			the user interface, it must be displayed explicitly, typically in a
			label. You want the list displayed when the app starts, so you'll add
			blocks to <strong>set</strong> the <strong>NumbersLabel</strong> in
			the <strong>Screen1.Initialize</strong> event handler: <br /> <img
				src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/screenInit.png" class="img-responsive"/><br /> The list is
			displayed in the default manner that occurs when you place a list
			directly into a label. Specifically, the items of the list are
			separated with spaces and the entire list is displayed within
			parenthesis.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">

		<h2>Challenge 1: Add up a List of Numbers</h2>
		<p>A second sub-goal for the app is to compute the total of the
			numbers in order to check the student's arithmetic. Keep in mind that
			you want blocks that will sum the list of numbers generically, i.e.,
			even if the items were changed or items were added, the computation
			would still work.</p>
		<p>
			In the final app you won't show the answer at all, you'll just
			compare the sum to whatever the user enters. But you're still working
			on an intermediate goal here, a test app. Your immediate goal is to
			sum the numbers and just display the result in the label named <strong>SumLabel</strong>.

		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">


		<H3>How Does Your Brain Add Up Numbers?</h3>
		Ask a friend to shout out some numbers to you while you sum them up.
		How do you do it? Our brains tends to work on auto-pilot, so this is
		not an easy question to answer. But to become a good programmer, you
		must learn to shut off the auto-pilot and examine your brain processes
		closely.
		</p>
		<p>If you're like most people, your "algorithm" for summing
			numbers is something like the following:
		<div class="well">Take the first number and remember it, then
			when the second number comes, add it to the first and remember the
			total. When the third number comes, add it to the previous total, and
			so on.</div>
		Your app needs to follow a similar algorithm, but of course
		translating the description to blocks is not so easy! First, you need
		a way to program, the "and so on" part of the description as you need
		a solution that will work no matter how many numbers are in the list
		(we want math problems of all sizes!). In programming, "and so on" is
		coded with <i>iteration</i> , that is, code that tells the app to
		repeat something some number of times.
		</p>
		<p>
			App Inventor, and most languages, provide a <strong>foreach</strong>
			construct, which basically says, "do the blocks inside for each item
			in the list": <br /> <img class="img-responsive" src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/foreach.png" /><br />
		</p>
		<p>
			If the list has three items, like our sample, the blocks inside the <strong>foreach</strong>
			will be repeated three times. If the list has four items, the blocks
			inside will be repeated four times, and so on. For the sample <strong>numbers</strong>
			list, the variable <strong>item</strong> will hold the value 5 on the
			first iteration, 11 on the second, and 7 on the third. So <strong>foreach</strong>
			is exactly what you want.
		</p>
		<p>
			But what do you want to do for each of those iterations-- what blocks
			go within the foreach? You want to add the next number in the list to
			a <i>running total</i>. Anytime your app needs to remember something,
			like a running total, you define a variable. In this case, you can
			define a variable "total" and give it an initial value of 0: <br />
			<img class="img-responsive" src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/varTotal.png" /><br />
		<p>
			For each item in your list, you add the item to the variable <strong>total</strong>.
			When the foreach completes (three iterations in this case), you can
			display the calculated total in a label: <br /> <img class="img-responsive"
				src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/foreachComplete.png" /><br />
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Design the User Interface</h2>
		<div class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>Now your app can create and display a list of numbers, and
					even add them up. Now its time to create the user interface for the
					complete version of MathBlaster. You'll need to rename some of the
					components, but your ultimate goal is for the user interface to
					appear as on the right. You'll need:
				<ol>
					<li>A new label for the "add up the following numbers:".</li>
					<li>Keep the "NumbersLabel" as is.</li>
					<li>A text box for the user's answer. Name it "AnswerText" and
						set its <strong>hint</strong> property to "enter the sum here".
					</li>
					<li>Two buttons, one named "AnswerButton" and one named
						"NextButton". The best way to do this is to just rename the
						ComputeButton "AnswerButton", then create a new button named
						"NextButton".</li>
					<li>A label that will say whether the user's answer is correct
						or not. Name it "AnswerCheckLabel".</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="span4">
				<img class="img-responsive" src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/mathBlaster2Marked.png" alt="">

			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Challenge 2: Compare the Computed Answer to the User's Answer</h2>
		<p>
			Now that your app knows how to add, you can set up it so the user can
			answer and have her answer checked. When the user clicks the
			AnswerButton, the app should still add up the numbers in the list.
			Instead of displaying that answer, the app should compare it-- the
			computed total-- to the answer submitted by the user in <strong>AnswerTextBox</strong>.
			Depending on the result, the app should display "correct" or
			"incorrect" in the <strong>AnswerCheckLabel</strong>: <br /> <img class="img-responsive"
				src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/checkAnswer.png" /><br />

		<h3>Challenge: Debugging the App</h3>
		<p>If you code the app with the blocks above, the app will not
			behave correctly. Before moving on, try to identify and fix the bug.
			When you are ready, click on "View Answer"</p>

		<div id="myCollapsibleExample">
			<a href="#demo3" data-toggle="collapse">View Answer</a>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div id="demo3" class="collapse">
		<p>
			The given solution works the first time the <strong>AnswerButton</strong>
			is clicked, but not the second. The problem is that the variable <strong>total</strong>
			is not reinitialized to zero on each click. So after the first time
			the button is clicked, <strong>total</strong> is set to 23. When the
			second click occurs, and AnswerButton.Click is triggered again, the
			list items will be added to the current value of <strong>total</strong>
			(23) and the result will be 46.
		</p>
		<p>
			The solution is simple: set <strong>total</strong> to zero at the top
			of the event handler: <br /> <img class="img-responsive"
				src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/checkAnswer2.png" /><br />
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Challenge 3: Generating a List of Random Numbers</h2>
		<p>The app thus far isn't much fun because the same problem is
			asked over and over. The next step is to add a "Next Problem" button
			and make it so that the app generates random problems each time it is
			clicked.</p>
		<p>For now, assume that you always want to generate exactly three
			random numbers. Later, you can modify the code so that problems of
			different sizes are generated. Also, assume that the numbers should
			be randomly chosen within the range 1-20.</p>
		<p>
			Here are the blocks for the <strong>NextButton.Click</strong> event
			handler: <br /> <img class="img-responsive" src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/random3.png" /><br />
		<p>
			The blocks first empty out the <strong>numbers</strong> list by
			setting it to an empty <strong>make a list</strong> block. Then <strong>add
				items to list</strong> is called to add the three random numbers. Finally,
			the <strong>NumbersLabel</strong> is updated to display the list and
			the <strong>AnswerTextBox</strong> is modified to erase the previous
			answer.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<h2>Challenge 4: Generating a Random Number of Random Numbers</h2>
		<p>So you now have a "Math Blaster" app but all the problems are
			exactly three numbers long. The next step is to eliminate this
			restriction so questions of different lengths will be generated and
			asked.</p>
		<p>
			Your task is to change the app so that the list of numbers has
			between two and five items on each question. For such a task, <strong>foreach</strong>
			isn't useful as you are not trying to iterate over the items of an
			existing list (you are creating a new one!). Instead, you need a <strong>while</strong>
			or <strong>for range</strong> as in the following solution: <br /> <img class="img-responsive"
				src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/randomNumItems.png" /><br />
		</p>
		<p>
			With a <strong>for range</strong>, the blocks within the "do" are
			performed some number of times as defined by a range. Think of the
			range <strong>i</strong> as a counter or index. In this case, it
			starts out as 1, on the first iteration. Each time the inner block (<strong>add
				items to list</strong>) is performed, the step (1) is added to <strong>i</strong>,
			until it reaches the end, which in this case is a random number
			between 2 and 5. So if the random integer generated is 4, the range
			will be 1-4 and the inner block will be performed four times.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the blocks within the <strong>NextButton.Click</strong>
			event handler should be copied to the <strong>Screen.Initialize</strong>
			event handler, as the first question should also be generated with a
			random number of items as opposed to the "fixed" three items in the <strong>numbers</strong>
			list definition. Furthermore, the <strong>numbers</strong> definition
			should have an empty <strong>make a list</strong> block within it
			instead of the three items that we used for the initial version of
			the app. An empty <strong>make a list</strong> block is a common
			pattern for defining a "dynamic" list: you are defining a list to
			hold items, but the items are generated as the app runs. Here are the
			blocks for these updates: <br /> <img class="img-responsive"
				src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/screenInitialize2.png" /><br />
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Challenge 5: Showing the + Signs in the Arithmetic</h2>
		<p>As is, the app displays the list of numbers within parenthesis
			and with spaces, not + signs, separating the numbers. Your next task
			is to change this so that a proper addition equation is displayed.
			For example, for the default list, your app should display "5+11+7",
			not "(5 11 7)"</p>
		<p>
			App Inventor doesn't provide a simple way to format list items
			nicely, so you'll have to use iteration-- a <strong>foreach</strong>--
			to walk through the list of numbers and build a text string with "+"
			between the numbers. You will build the text in NumbersLabel
			step-by-step, adding a number and a plus on each iteration:
		</p>
		<table class="table table-striped">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Iteration</th>
					<th>NumbersLabel</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>5+11</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>5+11+7</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

		<p>
			Here are the updated blocks: <br /> <img class="img-responsive"
				src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/displayPlus1.png" /><br /> Instead
			of just dumping the list into NumbersLabel, the label is built a
			number at a time, with the <strong>join</strong> block taking care of
			adding the "+" between each number.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
		<h3>Challenge: Debugging the App</h3>
		<p>The blocks above are close but not quite right. Before moving
			on, test the app and try to identify the issues and fix them. When
			you are ready, click on "View Solution"</p>

		<div id="myCollapsibleExample">
			<a href="#demo4" data-toggle="collapse">View Solution</a>
		</div>
		<div id="demo4" class="collapse">
			<p>
				The given solution leaves an additional "+" at the end of the
				equation, e.g., 5+11+7<strong>+</strong>. There are a number of ways
				to fix this, including using a different iteration block such as <strong>while-do</strong>
				or <strong>for range</strong>.
			</p>
			If the <strong>foreach</strong> block is retained, you need to add
			some blocks to "post-process" the label and remove the last "+": <br />
			<img src="{{apps2Dir}}/mathBlaster/displayPlusFix.png" class="img-responsive" /><br />
			<p>The segment block takes a part (segment) of some text, in this
				case starting from the first character and taking all but the last
				character (the unwanted "+").</p>
			<p>
				Note that you'll need to update the <strong>Screen.Initialize</strong>
				event handler with these blocks as well so the first question will
				appear correctly
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Refactoring</h2>
		<p>Effective software engineers know that having redundant code
			(blocks) in an app is bad practice: if something changes, you have to
			find all copies of the code and make the change. Copying and pasting
			blocks, as done above, is a sub-optimal solution. A better solution
			involves refactoring the blocks and defining a procedure.</p>
