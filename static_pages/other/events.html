<h2>How do you program an app’s event-response behavior?</h2>
          <p>
			Think of an app like an event-response machine. The user clicks a button, 
			the app responds. A text comes in, the app sends an auto-reply. 
			A flying saucer hits an asteroid, it blows up. Your job as a programmer 
			is to program such event-responses. In App Inventor, you do this directly-- 
			your code is essentially a set of event-responses, of when-do blocks. Check out the following samples:
		  </p> 
       <div class="row-fluid">
       	<div class="span6">
       	<a name="redbutton"></a> 
		  <h3>Example 1. How do you turn a button red when the user clicks it?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/Events/buttonRed.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
			OK, this is a really silly app but it will get us started. The app appears 
			and there is a gray button. When the user touches (clicks) the button, the
			 button's color changes to red.
			The click of the button, <span class="empfont">Button1.Click</span>, is an event, 
			something that can happen to the app. The gold when 
			<span class="empfont">Button1.Click</span> block is called an event-handler. 
			The blocks inside it are the response to the event. set means to change something, 
			in this case, change the button’s <span class="empfont">BackgroundColor</span> to red. The blocks, as a whole, 
			specify that when the user clicks the button it should turn red.

		<h3>Example 2. How do you say "I’m shaking” when the user shakes the phone?</h3>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/Events/shakeSpeak.png" border="0"/>
		<p>
			This app has two components, an <span class="empfont">AccelerometerSensor</span> 
			and a <span class="empfont">TextToSpeech</span>. When the user shakes the phone 
			or tablet, the <span class="empfont">AccelerometerSensor</span> senses the event and 
			the <span class="empfront">when AccelerometerSensor1.Shaking</span> event handler is triggered. 
			The <span class="empfront">TextToSpeech</span> component is called to carry out the response of 
			speaking the words “I’m shaking”.
