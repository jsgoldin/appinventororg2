			<h1>Publishing your app</h1>

			<h4>
				These instructions describe how to publish your app on the web
				and/or in the App Inventor gallery (which is now integrated into
				App Inventor itself). On your app page, you'll
				create a barcode for your app and provide a link to the source
				blocks. Once your app page is setup you can send your friends and
				family the URL so that they can download your app and try it out.

		<h3>Setup a web portfolio</h3>
		<p>
			If you haven't setup a web page for your portfolio, do so now. Google
			Sites (sites.google.com) is one of the simplest methods, instructions
			for this setup are located <a
				href="/content/CourseInABox/Intro/PortfolioHowTo">here</a>.

		<H3>Give your app a descriptive name, title, and icon.</H3>
		<p>Give your app a descriptive name (e.g., not "Project 2"). The
			name of an App Inventor app is the project name-- this name appears
			on the phone when it is installed. You can change this name by doing
			a SaveAs of your project.</p>
		<p>Give your app a descriptive screen title (this can be same as
			project name). The screen title is a property of the Screen
			component. It appears at the top of screen when your app runs.

	<div class="card">
		<p>Give your app an icon. The icon is the little square image that
			appears on the device once an app is installed. The icon is a
			property of the Screen component and you can set it to any image
			file.

		<H3>Download your app APK and source code</H3>
		<p>Download the APK file of your app to your computer. An APK file
			has a .apk extension and is the executable app that runs on the
			device. You generate an app's APK file in App Inventor by selecting
			"Build | App (save.apk to my computer)".

		<p>Download source code to computer. The source code (blocks)
			allow you or others to edit/customize the app. You generate source
			code for an app in App Inventor from the Project page. Check your
			project, then choose Project and Export selected project (.aia) to my
			computer from the dropdown menu.

				href="http://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/">http://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/</a>,
				paste that URL, select Static below the textbox, and click Generate.
				Once you have created the code take a screenshot to keep the image.
