High schools will soon be teaching <strong>AP Computer Science Principles</strong>, a much more accessible introduction
to computer science than the current Java curriculum. This is great news, and <strong>Ralph Morelli</strong> has
developed an<a href="http://mobile-csp.org/"> AP CSP course</a> that uses App Inventor as the programming language! Check out his curriculum which
has been successfully taught by high school teachers who are not formerly trained in 
Computer Science or Math. An on-line version of the course is coming soon!.
