		  <h3>Example 1. How do you move a sprite down, smoothly, at 100 pixels a second</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/sprites/moveDown.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>An ImageSprite's speed, pixels/second, is actually determined by two properties.
		   The Interval property specifies how often the sprite will be moved-- it is similar
		   to the TimerInterval property of the Clock component. The Speed property specifies
		   how many pixels the sprite will move each interval (the property is misnamed). In this
		   example, the sprite moves 5 pixels per 50 ms, or 1 pixel per 10 ms, which is 100 pixels/second.
		   </p>
		   <p>
		   A Sprite's Heading property specifies the direction it moves. As shown below,
		   a Heading of 270 degrees will move the sprite down.

			<h3>Example 2. How do you make a ball bounce?</h3>
			<img class="thumbnail" src="/assets/img/sprites/bounce.png" border="0"/>
			<p>
			App Inventor provides a Bounce block that causes a ball to bounce off the edge
			of a canvas. You typically use Bounce within the EdgeReached event handler, as
			that event handler tells you which edge was hit, as a parameter, and you can
			plug that parameter into the Bounce function (which need to know which edge
			of the canvas to bounce off).
			</p>
			<p>You can also bounce off other objects (sprites or balls). The CollidedWith
			event handler is triggered when you hit another object. The Bounce function
			only works off a Canvas edge, so you cannot use it. But you can make the ball
			bounce in the other direction by setting its Heading property to 360 minus its
			current setting, as in the blocks above.
