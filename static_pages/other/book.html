                <a href="http://www.amazon.com/App-Inventor-Create-Your-Android/dp/1449397484/">App Inventor: Create your own Android Apps</a>, published by O'Reilly in 2011, is now available in PDF form here at appinventor.org. The links to the right 
		get you to PDF versions of each
                chapter, or to a page with the PDF and accompanying video lessons. The book was written by USF Professor
                David Wolber along with App Inventor creator and MIT Professor Hal Abelson and
                Google engineers Ellen Spertus and Liz Looney.The book is designed for absolute beginners but also useful as a reference to programmers
                looking to add App Inventor to their arsenal.
            </p>

            <p>The book is organized in a way to motivate learning. The first section walks you through the creation of twelve successively more complex apps that you can build and customize. Find something you'd similar to what you'd like to build and go for it. The apps section is
                followed by a separate "Inventor's Manual" section which explains programming and computer science
                concepts in layperson's terms. This section is organized by programming topic as in a traditional text.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Interested in building apps but don't have a year to learn Java? Teaching
                an introductory (CS0) computer science course to K-12 or university students? This book is for you!
            </p>

            <p>
                The paperback version is a great companion to app building-- you can use the book to read the tutorial
                and save your screen for all of the App Inventor windows. Buy it cheap at <a

			<p> <em>Note: A new version of App Inventor was launched in December, 2013. We are working on a 2nd edition of the App Inventor book for the new AI version and plan
			to have it out by August 1, 2014 (you can preview it <a href="/book2">here</a>). The components and blocks in the two AI versions are basically the same, so the samples 
			in the original book are still helpful in learning App Inventor, but App Inventor 2 and the upcoming book are definitely the way to go. </em</p>
